# monitor
This repository will be dedicated to the development of the water quality monitor hardware.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing open-source hardware for water quality monitoring. The goal is to create an affordable and efficient monitoring kit that can be assembled and used by communities worldwide.

## Objectives
- Design and build a water quality monitoring kit.
- Provide detailed assembly instructions and documentation.
- Develop firmware to operate the monitoring hardware.
