## Notes
1. **Solar Panels**: The size of the solar panel will depend on the consumption of each component and the hours of sun in the specific location.
2. **Antennas**: The choice of antenna is key to maximizing coverage. You can opt for directional antennas if the monitors are aligned along the river.
